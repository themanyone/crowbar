The status update is at the top and search bar is at the bottom.

Trending topics appear in the search bar's drop-down list.

To refresh trending topics you have to press the Refresh button.

To see someone else's timeline, enter their name into the search bar.

Because of the above, in order to see your own timeline you must first clear the search bar before pressing the timeline button (or enter your own username). Not sure what to do about this. Probably leave it as it is, quirky, but something to be aware of. :)
